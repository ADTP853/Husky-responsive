                        Hey guys, welcome to our website here at Husky.com  where we go through everything husky related. From training,
                        to feeding, to which beds are suitable, we've got you covered. This is your one stop place to learn about
                        this fantastic breed which will have both you and your husky wagging your tails and hanging your tounges out.
                        Send us an email with your husky to have a chance of being placed in our gallery which we rotate through every
                        month. Have fun!!

                        It's hard knowing what to feed our huskies when there's so much different and conflicting information
                        out there. Well look know further. We at Husky know that a raw diet is exactly the thing to get our
                        huskies stomachs full of good energy whilst maintaining a healthy diet. Check out our food section for 
                        recipe ideas, all of which show a estimated cost for a naturally balanced diet.

                        A rope, no a ball, no the neighbours cat, ok the kong. Huskies are hillarious when it comes to play time 
                        and we at Husky know the mindset of huskies run wild with both anticipation and excitement when it comes
                        to playing with toys. We also know though that some toys only last for a matter of seconds with this breed
                        which causes owners one bored husky and one quickly created mess. Check out our toy section to see the most
                        suited toys out on the market for our husky friends.
